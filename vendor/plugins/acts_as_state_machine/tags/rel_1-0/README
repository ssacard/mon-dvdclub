= Acts As State Machine

This act gives an Active Record model the ability to act as a finite state
machine (FSM).

== Example

	class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
	  acts_as_state_machine :initial => :opened

	  state :opened
	  state :closed, Proc.new {|o| Mailer.send_notice(o)}
	  state :returned

	  event :close do
	    transitions :to => :closed, :from => :opened
	  end

	  event :return do
	    transitions :to => :returned, :from => :closed
	  end
	end

	o = Order.create
	o.close! # notice is sent by mailer
	o.return!
